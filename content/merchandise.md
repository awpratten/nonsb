## LAST CONCERT IN JAPAN   CD   Alchemy   2016   TECH-24486
In March, 2016, the Nihilist Spasm Band was invited by Jojo Hiroshige and Alchemy Records to play two concerts at Shinjuku Pit Inn, a legendary Tokyo jazz club.  It was twenty years almost to the day since Hiroshige had hosted the band on its first Japanese tour, and it was his way of honouring their fifty-plus years of pioneering noise improvisation.

The second half of each show was a series of jam sessions, inspired by the historic No Music Festival jams, involving various members of the band playing with some of Japan's most illustrious musicians.

Included with the beautifully designed CD is a gorgeous twelve page booklet.  The text is in Japanese, but it is jam packed with outstanding colour and b & w photos taken during the concert
